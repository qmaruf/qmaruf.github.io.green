After graduating with a Bachelor and Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, I obtained my PhD degree from the Queensland University of Technology, Australia, supervised by Dr Feras Dayoub in September 2021. 

My PhD research, titled "[Performance Monitoring of Deep Learning Vision Systems During Deployment](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/229733/1/Quazi%20Marufur_Rahman_Thesis.pdf)" delves into the vital realm of ensuring the reliability and accuracy of vision-based systems in mobile robotics. Through innovative techniques, I've tackled challenges in object detection and semantic segmentation performance monitoring. These contributions advance the state-of-the-art by enhancing our ability to monitor deep learning vision systems during deployment, without relying on ground truth labels. Explore these breakthroughs and more in my publications below.
